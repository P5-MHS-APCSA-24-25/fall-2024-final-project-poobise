# Program Design Document
For my Advanced Placement Computer Science A Class Final, I will be creating, making, and programming an incremental idle game, such as the likes of "Cookie Clicker", a webgame made by Ian Bogost, who had already released another idle game in the past, which was called "Cow Clicker". "Cookie Clicker" has also been ported to steam, even though the game originally came from just a single link. The game offers thousands of hours of gameplay off clicking a cookie, and "Grass cutting incremental", a game on Roblox which involves cutting grass by controlling an avatar which you are able to move with the WASD keys on your keyboard, and also offers thousands of hours of gameplay, which again, relies off a very simple premise, just like the game mentioned before, "Cookie Clicker". My game will will involve pressing the enter key to "click" a smiley face. In the game, you will be able to buy multiple upgrades, which will allow you to progress further through the game. When starting the game, progress will be slow, as you have nothing to help you click faster, or gain clicks. The first upgrade will be a _, which gives 10% of a click every second. You would be able to buy multiple of the same upgrade, up to a fixed amount. The more of the same upgrade you buy, the more the upgrade will cost, but it will not affect the cost of other upgrades. Upgrades will be bought by pressing the "s" key on your keyboard, which will open a shop and allow the player to buy upgrades, by pressing the number keys.
