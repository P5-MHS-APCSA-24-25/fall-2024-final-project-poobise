# Program Design Document
For my APCSA Class Final, I will be programming an incremental game, like "Cookie Clicker," a webgame which offers thousands of hours of gameplay off clicking a cookie. The name of my game is "Brian Hitter". My game will involve inputting strings of text to hit Brian. The longer the input, the more hits are gained. In the game, you will be able to buy multiple upgrades, which will allow you to progress further through the game. The goal of the game is to get as many hits as possible. The game works with a while loop, which checks for an input from the user. If there is an input, then the string is checked if it equals "shop" or if the shop is currently open, which if true, then  the string is returned and the shop is opened via a boolean called shopOpen, now set to true. If the input is not "shop" then the string's length is turned into a double, returned, and added to the total hit amount. While the shopOpen boolean  is true, the amount of hits is not displayed or changable, as all inputs are now used to buy items. Inputting certain strings of letters will buy certain upgrades in the shop. For example, inputting "b" will buy an upgrade that increases the amount gained from each string by 1. Upgrades are classed with Items, which have many different parameters, like the name, the value to be added or multiplied, whether the upgrade adds or multiplies, if the upgrade is automatic or happens on hit, and a few other parameters. Buying an item from the shop puts the upgrade into an array, called inventory. Once in the inventory, the item is classed into one of two arrays, being hitItems, and autoItems. Every time an input is detected while not in the shop, a check is run to see what items are in hitItems, and the values of the items are added or multiplied to the total amount to be gained, depending on the parameters that were set. A problem I had was with organization, as I found it very hard to organize my game loop code, my upgrade code, and my code for checking inputs. Having all my code in one file made it difficult to find what I needed, however I fixed this problem by splitting my code into 3 different classes, for the 3 main parts of my game. Another problem I encountered was that I couldn't increase the length of an array, which wouldn't be a problem, except that some of my relied on the length of an array. However, I fixed this problem by making a function which would copy the length of the original array, add one, and then reinput the same values as the original, as well as a new value.
