# Program Design Document
For my Advanced Placement Computer Science A Class Final, I will be creating, making, and programming an incremental idle game, such as the likes of "Cookie Clicker," a webgame made by Ian Bogost, who had already released another idle game in the past, which was called "Cow Clicker." "Cookie Clicker" has also been ported to steam, even though the game originally came from just a single link. The game offers thousands of hours of gameplay off clicking a cookie, and "Grass cutting incremental," a game on Roblox which involves cutting grass by controlling an avatar which you are able to move with the WASD keys on your keyboard, and also offers thousands of hours of gameplay, which again, relies off a very simple premise, just like the game mentioned before, "Cookie Clicker." The name of my game is "Brian Hitter". My game will will involve pressing the inputting key inputs to hit a Brian. The longer the input, the more hits are gained. In the game, you will be able to buy multiple upgrades, which will allow you to progress further through the game. When starting the game, progress will be slow, as you have nothing to help you hit faster, or gain more hits. The first upgrade would be called "foreign friends", which gives 10% of a hit every second. You would be able to buy multiple of the same upgrade, up to a fixed amount. The more of the same upgrade you buy, the more the upgrade will cost, but it will not affect the cost of other upgrades. Upgrades will be bought by typing in "shop" with your keyboard, which will open a shop and allow the player to buy upgrades, by pressing keys, which will correspond to different upgrades.
